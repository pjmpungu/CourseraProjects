For the HKPSolutions app, it seems to me that we can stick to the basic frameworks that Android Studio always provides. The most important framework will be the implementation 
of a Content Provider which will hold the data on how productive housekeepers are, and will also hold the account information for each user, since we'll need
different accounts for housekeepers, managers, and front desk users. Aside from that, we should use the View System, Resource Manager, and Activity Manager frameworks
to implement basic functionality, like navigating around the app and displaying information.
